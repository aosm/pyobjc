Stable releases
---------------

The stable release front is rather hazy at the moment, I'm sorry for that and intend to fix that in the near feature.

The short story:

* On Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) the stable release is PyObjC 2.0, which is included in the OS distribution. You can also
  install this from source if you do a checkout of the repository (the repository URL is 
  http://svn.red-bean.com/pyobjc/trunk).

* On earlier releases of Mac OS X the stable release of PyObjC is 1.4, which can be dowloaded from the repository as
  well (the repository URL is http://svn.red-bean.com/pyobjc/branches/pyobjc-1.4-branch).


Unstable releases
-----------------

The current beta release is PyObjC 2.2b1. This release can be installed using ``easy_install``::

  $ easy_install pyobjc=2.2b1

This will *not* install Py2app, you'll have to install that manually.
