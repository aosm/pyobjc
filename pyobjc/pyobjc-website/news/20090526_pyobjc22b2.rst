PyObjC 2.2b2 released
=====================

PyObjC 2.2b2 is the second beta release for PyObjC 2.2. 
There are relatively few user-visibly changes from the last
release. 

This release can be installed using ``easy_install``

Usage::

   $ easy_install pyobjc==2.2b2

This will install the core bridge as well as all stable
framework wrappers.

*NOTE*: This is a beta release, which means there are still
know issues with this release although it should in general be
stable and an improvement over the last release.

*NOTE2*: easy_install will not install py2app, you will have
to install that manually.
