PyObjC 1.1b1 released
=====================

A new prerelease of the upcoming 1.1 release of PyObjC is available.

Please report any problem with this release at pyobjc-dev@lists.sourceforge.net.

**NOTE:** Python 2.2 support is tested less than Python 2.3 support, because
most developers have moved to Mac OS X 10.3.
