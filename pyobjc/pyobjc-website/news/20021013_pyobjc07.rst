Interim release 0.7.0
=====================

On or about this date, an interim release of PyObjC was made available as a disk image that contained the 
binary module (compatible with Apple's build of Python included with OS X 10.2), a Project Builder project 
template for building Cocoa applications using Python, and a basic README.

Version 0.7.0 represents a huge step forward over the previous version (0.6.1).  Of note, 0.7.0 vastly 
improved the inter-language messaging mechanism, the bridging of various classes, improved support for 
features specific to the Foundation and AppKit, support for the Address Book framework, and subclassing 
of Objective-C classes in Python.
