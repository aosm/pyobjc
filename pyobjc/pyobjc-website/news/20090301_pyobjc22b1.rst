PyObjC 2.2b1 released
=====================

PyObjC 2.2b1 is the first beta release for PyObjC 2.2. 
There are relatively few user-visibly changes from the last
release. The most important ones are:

 * This release can be installed using ``easy_install``

   Usage::

      $ easy_install pyobjc==2.2b1

   This will install the core bridge as well as all stable
   framework wrappers.

 * Most framework wrappers ship with unittests that verify
   that the wrappers actually work as intended.

   These tests are not yet entirely complete, but have already
   helped in finding and fixing a number of issues.

*NOTE*: This is a beta release, which means there are still
know issues with this release although it should in general be
stable and an improvement over the last release.

*NOTE2*: easy_install will not install py2app, you will have
to install that manually.
