.. __: /NEWS-2.0.html

* The package ``pyobjc`` is split into several smaller packages, this will make future updates easier.

* PyObjC now supports the bridgesupport metadata format, which makes it easier to support new frameworks
  without having to write C code. The same metadata format is also used by RubyCocoa.

* Class methods are modelled better, allowing one have a class method and instance method with the same name (
  which is used in several occassions in the Cocoa frameworks).
