API Notes for framework LaunchServices
======================================

* ``LSSharedFileListSetAuthorization``

  Not supported at the moment because the Authorization framweork isn't properly 
  wrapped yet.

* ``LSLaunchFSRefSpec``, ``LSLaunchURLSpec``

  These types aren't supported in this version.

* ``LSOpenApplication``

  This function is not yet supported. The bridge itself isn't smart
  enough yet to process the first argument without a manual wrapper.

* ``LSOpenItemsWithRole``, ``LSOpenURLsWithRole``

  The ``inAEParam`` and ``inAppParams`` must be None.

* ``LSOpenFromRefSpec``, ``LSOpenFromURLSpec``

  This functions are not yet supported and need manual wrappers.
