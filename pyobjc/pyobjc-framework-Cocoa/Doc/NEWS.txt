NEWS file for pyobjc-framework-Cocoa
====================================

Version 2.3
-----------

* BUGFIX: The framework wrappers for Cocoa now actually work in
  64-bit code.

* BUGFIX: Remove loads of unnecessary definitions from the bridgesupport
  files. This seriously reduces the size of those files, and more 
  importantly the size of running PyObjC-based programs without affecting
  functionality.

* Merge the C extensions, there are now two extensions left
  per framework: one contains a list of inline functions for use
  by the bridgesupport loeader, the other manual wrappers for
  a number of functions.

* (In progress) Port to python 3.x

Version 2.2
-----------

* Introduce bindings for SnowLeopard (MacOSX 10.6)

* Introduce ``Foundation.NSDisabledSuddenTermination``, 
  a context object for use with python's ``with`` statement::

     with NSDisabledSuddenTermination:
     	# Sudden termination is disabled here
	pass

* Introduce unittests that check that API bindings actually
  work, in particular all bindings that require custom 
  metadata
