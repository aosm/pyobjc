=================================
API Notes for the QTKit framework
=================================

* Functions ``QTMakeTimeWithTimeRecord`` and ``QTGetTimeRecord`` are not 
  supported.

* The integration with classical Quicktime API is not properly tested at the 
  moment.  Furthermore that API is deprecated by Apple, and not available
  in 64-bit code. Use the QTKit API where possible.
