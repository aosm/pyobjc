<p> Forward Note: This forward is for informational purposes only. </p>
<p> The PyOpenGL project on SourceForge was started by David Ascher,
previous maintainer of the PyOpenGL package, to further development of
the binding while David was unable to continue such development. At the
time of the project's start, PyOpenGL was version 1.5.5. You can find
this version of the package on the downloads page of the project. </p>
<p> Because of this history, there are two licenses which pertain to the
library, both of which are "BSD Style" licenses (though with minor
variations in wording). </p>
<p> For all versions up to and including 1.5.5, the <a
 href="licenses-1.5.5.html" title="PyOpenGL 1.5.5 License">PyOpenGL
1.5.5 License</a> is applicable. </p>
<p> For all versions greater than 1.5.5, both the PyOpenGL 1.5.5 License
and the <a href="licenses-1.5.6.html" title="PyOpenGL 1.5.6 License">PyOpenGL
1.5.6 License</a> are applicable. </p>
<p> For all versions of PyOpenGL greater than or equal to 2.0 the
following licenses also apply </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>the <a href="licenses-GLE.html" title="GLE License">GLE License</a>
applies to the GLE module</li>
  <li>the <a href="licenses-PyGLUT.html" title="PyGLUT License">PyGLUT
License</a> applies to the GLUT module (PyOpenGL's GLUT module is a
derivative of PyGLUT).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: earlier versions of the 2.0 series mistakenly suggested that
the <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/FreeB" target="_top">SGI Free
Software License B</a> applied to them. The interface files are, indeed,
based partly on the GL.h and GLU.h header files, but as the information
provided in those files (as limited to that provided in the interface
files) is a mere statement of fact, it shouldn't be considered a
copyrightable body of work.<br>

please contact the <a href="mailto:pyopengl-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">PyOpenGL
