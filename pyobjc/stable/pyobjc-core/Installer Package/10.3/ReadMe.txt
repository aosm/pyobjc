Welcome to PyObjC
=================

The PyObjC package provides the glue needed to interface the Python interpreter
with the Objective-C language. At its core is the ``objc`` module makes 
Objective-C objects and classes available as first-class Python citizens. It is 
not only possible to use Objective-C objects but you can also subclass 
Objective-C classes.

To make it easier to use the core ``objc`` module, this package also provides 
a number of modules that are wrappers for the Cocoa frameworks, such as
Foundation and AppKit. These modules not only give you access to the classes in
these frameworks but also to the functions and constants in those modules.

To install this package double-click on ``PyObjC.pkg``. This will install the
PyObjC python package and some Project Builder templates. The documentation
and examples are found in  the folder ``PyObjC Documentation and Examples``. 
Install these by dragging this folder to you disk, ``/Library/Documentation``
is a suitable location.

NOTE: This installer package is for Mac OS X 10.3. There is a seperate installer
for Mac OS X 10.2 with the Python 2.2 supplied by Apple. If you use 
MacPython 2.3 on Mac OS X 10.2 you should use the ``Package Manager`` 
application to install PyObjC. In other situation you can install PyObjC from 
the source archive.
