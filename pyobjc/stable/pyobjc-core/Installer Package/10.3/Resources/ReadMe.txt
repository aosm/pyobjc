The PyObjC package provides the glue needed to interface the Python interpreter with the Objective-C language. The 'objc' module makes Objective-C objects and classes available as first-class Python citizens, it is not only possible to use Objective-C objects but you can also subclass Objective-C classes.

This package also installs modules that provide convenient access to (most of) the Foundation, AppKit, WebKit and AddressBook frameworks. This makes it easy to build Cocoa applications in Python. 

Other than the Python modules the installer also installs:
- Xcode templates (in /Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools)
- Documentation (in /Developer/Python/PyObjC/Documentation)
- Examples (in /Developer/Python/PyObjC/Examples)
